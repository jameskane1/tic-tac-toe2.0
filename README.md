Resources Used
To complete this project i relied heavily on our class work documentation, especially for the api work I referencec the steps we used for all the ajax trainings.

I also used W3 schools and stackoverflow to identify workarounds when I was stuck, for example when my boarders were triggering handler events I looked at stack overflow to see an example of how I can use background-color and margins to bypass having boarders.


Planning Documentation

My first step for attacking this project was to look at the suggested schedule and map out each of the tasks that i would have to finish in order to complete the items in the schedule. This allowed me to break down the larger problems to smaller bite size problems that I could knock out one at a time.

After identify each of the small problems I cam up with a proposed solution of the board which was to use an array that represents each of the boxes in a tic tac toe board. This allowed me to map out all the potential combinations that would be a win, 0-1-2, 0-3-6, etc. and let me us that as a funciton to determine winner.

After completing the game logic I used the documentation from class to correctly hook up the api using the tools from the project api rep to make sure I was using and passing the correct data that the API was looking for.

Finally I used stack overflow and w3schools to help me style my pages properly with css.

Unsolved Problems

At this point I do not have any unsolved problems for my MVP
